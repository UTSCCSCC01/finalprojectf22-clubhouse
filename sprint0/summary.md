## The Project Objective

---

The objective of this web application is to bridge the gap between students and clubs at UTSC, by providing students with a central hub where they can easily connect with clubs and keep up-to-date with upcoming events. In particular, this web application would allow students, especially first years, to easily discover clubs and events that align with their interests. Additionally, this application makes it easier for clubs to reach out to new students who may be interested in joining or attending their events.

## The Key Personas

---

Francisco de Silva - An eighteen year-old international first year Management student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. He is a very responsible, energetic and outgoing person. As a first year student, he looks forward to meeting new people and wants to be actively involved with extracurriculars during his time at university.

Sarah McLaurhen - A twenty-three year old Management student at the University of Toronto who is actively involved in UTSC's Association of Accounting (AOA). She currently holds two executive positions at AOA as the VP of Operations and an Events Director. 

## The Key Scenarios

---

* Having just moved to Canada, Francisco is eager to meet new like-minded people through the various clubs and student associations at UTSC. While he finds some success finding interesting clubs via Instagram and the UTSC Club Hub website, he finds it difficult to search for new clubs on Instagram and is disappointed by the lack of clubs listed on Club Hub. He wishes there was an easier way to discover clubs and events that interest him.

* Currently, Sarah's team primarily uses Instagram to connect with students, but Sarah and her team wishes there was a way to promote their events and initiatives to a wider group of students who may not follow them on Instagram or know about their club.

## The Key Principles

* Community: This web application should make it easier for students to discover and stay up-to-date with the various clubs UTSC has to offer.
* Ease of use: The design should be intuitive and simple. Users should be able to navigate through the website with ease.
